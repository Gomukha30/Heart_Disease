# Heart_Disease


This project uses machine learning to predict heart disease presence based on patient health metrics. Key stages include:

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the dataset for training, handling missing values and standardizing features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigates data distributions and relationships between variables to inform model selection.
Model Training: Tests multiple models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.
Evaluation: Compares model accuracy, precision, and recall to identify the optimal approach.
